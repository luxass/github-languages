            I found some new changes in GitHub's Linguist Repository.

            I don't know what they changed, but I'm sure it's important.
            If you want you can go take a look yourself.

            I will be waiting for your approval ðŸ‘‹.

            This is an automated PR to update GitHub Languages.
